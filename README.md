# the_Game

My Game is called Soul Armaggedon!

You are a hero and you fight the demon the Soul Stealer

You have two moves, an attack called blade waltz and a defensive move called storm crescendo that lowers the accuracy and damage 
of the Soul Stealers next attack and if she misses you gain health.

I wanted to have 3 demons, all increasing in power and a party of heroes to choose from but the difficulty was too high.  

I will continue working however!!!

I have minor errors commented in the code of blockers.
