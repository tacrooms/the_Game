# the_Game

My Game is called Soul Armaggedon!

I wanted the game play to be: you and computer have 20 Life Points.  You have a party of 4 heroes and the computer has 4 bosses back to back.  Each of your heroes has strengths and weaknesses (hi dmg/low acc hi acc/low dmg hi magic damage/very low HP) and you would switch out teams as strategically fit. you cannot kill heroes or demons only kock them out of play for two turns.  When a player has no heroes or demons on the battle field you can attack the players life points.  First player to lose all Life Points loses.

this was far to ambitious.

i was able to get the battle field set up and one battle and two moves.  Three moves for the boss.  The boss has a 'basic attack' a semi strong attack and an ultimate attack all randomly chosen each turn.  The stronger the attack the lower the accuracy.

You are a hero and you fight the demon the Soul Stealer

You have two moves, an attack called blade waltz and a defensive move called storm crescendo that lowers the accuracy and damage 
of the Soul Stealers next attack and if she misses you gain health.

I wanted to have 3 demons, all increasing in power and a party of heroes to choose from but the difficulty was too high.  

I will continue working however!!!

I have minor errors commented in the code of blockers.
